Patch Management for LPSCoin Debian Packaging
=============================================

This directory contains patches applied to the LPSCoin source code for Debian packaging. Patches are organized using a numbered prefix scheme to indicate their origin and relevance:

- **0xxx**: Patches sourced directly from upstream LPSCoin development (https://github.com/Luxury-Property-Solutions-LLC/LPSCoin). These are typically bug fixes or features already merged into the main repository as of version 4.1.0 (March 2025).
- **1xxx**: Patches potentially suitable for upstream adoption. These address issues or enhancements that could benefit the broader LPSCoin project but have not yet been submitted or accepted upstream.
- **2xxx**: Patches specific to the official Debian release. These are tailored for Debian packaging requirements (e.g., filesystem standards, dependencies) and are not intended for upstream inclusion.

Patch Format
------------
Patches should follow the standard Debian quilt format:
- Filename: `<number>-<description>.patch`
- Include a header with `Description:`, `Author:`, and `Date:` fields.
- Use `git format-patch` or `diff -u` for consistency.

Applying Patches
----------------
To apply patches during Debian package building:
1. Place patches in this directory.
2. Update `debian/patches/series` with the patch filenames in the desired order.
3. Use `quilt` or the Debian build system (`dpkg-source`) to apply them.

Contributing
------------
- For upstream-relevant patches (1xxx), consider submitting a pull request to https://github.com/Luxury-Property-Solutions-LLC/LPSCoin.
- For Debian-specific patches (2xxx), file issues or patches via the Debian bug tracker or this repositoryâ€™s Debian packaging section.
- Ensure patches align with LPSCoin 4.1.0 and test against the latest `lpscoinsd` and `lpscoins-qt` builds.
